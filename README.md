This is a final project submission for the for the Coursera Getting and 
Cleaning Data course.

#######################################################################

The project includes the following files:

1. README.md - this file describing the project and its contents

2. CodeBook.md - a code book containing a description of the variables, the 
data, and all work performed on the data to transform it into the final tidy
state

3. run_analysis.R - The R script that was used to prepare the final tidy dataset
of subject and group means from the source data

4. tidy_complete.csv - A tidy data set comprising data from both the "test" and
"train" subsets from the original data set for each mean and standard deviation
variable in the original UCI HAR Dataset "Human Activity Recognition Using 
Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0"

5. tidy_means.csv - A tidy data set reporting the mean of each mean and standard
deviation variable for each subject and activity in the original UCI HAR Dataset
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0"

All raw data used in this cleaning/analysis was collected
as part of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"
Version 1.0 by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and
Luca Oneto. More information can be found at
